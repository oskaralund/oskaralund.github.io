      I have been working in the field of computational mathematics for about a decade. Programming and mathematics has been my passion since I got my first computer at age 12. I've contributed to research and business projects in the fields of real time physics simulation, numerical solutions to partial differential equations, domain decomposition, non-conforming grid couplings, fluid dynamics, quantum dynamics, and risk modelling. In my spare time I like to read and talk about philosophy, dabble in web design, do programming puzzles, and exercise.
