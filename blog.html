    <p>I'm a mad procrastinator. It's always the same routine. Things I should be doing pile up while I feel guilty not doing them. I suppose I should warn you from the outset that I'm not going to offer any advice on how to solve this. In fact I think I'm only writing this as some desperate attempt at self help. You know what, that's probably not true. No use introspecting when I'm actually being productive. Best just to keep writing and not think too much.</p>

    <p>Glad you stayed for the second paragraph. This one is going to feel way more coherent, I promise. Anyway, as I said, I'm a mad procrastinator and it has brought me great anxiety through the years. No amount of tips or tricks or reading elaborate theories on energy minimization has helped. Make lists, have a routine, just do it, don't wait for inspiration. Whatever. I'm here to tell you what I've come to understand as the sad truth. <em>THERE IS NO CURE</em>. No matter what you read, no matter what anybody tells you, you will keep procrastinating, you will keep feeling guilty, and you will keep delivering below your potential.</p>

    <p>I'm sorry to go against the stream of internet productivity heroes here. But if you're like me, perhaps it will bring you some comfort to know that you're not alone. It's also worth contemplating the fact that a fair number of people procrastinate and <em>do not feel guilty</em> and end up <em>not delivering at all</em>. Of course these people are likely happier than you or me, but at least we're <em>better</em> than them, right? Actually we're not. That's a twisted and self-aggrandizing way to think.</p>

    <p>So let me leave you with a simple thought. You are not better than anyone else. There is no way out of this struggle. However, you have plenty of joy in your life anyway. What, is it supposed to be <em>all good</em>? Be a little grateful for christ's sake.</p>
